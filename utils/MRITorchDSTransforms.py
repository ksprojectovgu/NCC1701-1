"""
This module contains all the Transforms that can be applied on the MRI PyTorch Custom Dataset
All the transforms are written as callable classes instead of simple functions so that parameters of the transform need not be passed everytime itâ€™s called.
Contains a couple of dummy transforms code

Includes transforms taken from fastMRI, where the copyright belongs to Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.
